## Devising of a pedestrian typology from a household travel survey and mapping of the resulting profiles: the example of Bogotá 

This blog presents a method for devising a typology of walkers based on from a Household Travel Survey conducted in 2019 in Bogotá, and available in open data. The analysis combines sociodemographic characteristics of individuals and variables describing their mobility practices. Maps showing the concentration of the places of residence of the six walker profiles are also proposed. The profiles clearly show the mobility of the caretaker, and more surprisingly, the practice of walking among more affluent individuals living in the business districts of the city. These results can contribute to the reflections of decision-makers on the mobility of care, and more generally on pedestrian mobility. The method developed in R is replicable to other urban areas and other groups of people using other modes, such as cycling.
